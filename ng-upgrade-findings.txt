- Options page does not open when an extension page is already open (because of location hash)
- Player popup is empty (probably also because of location hash)
- Refused to apply inline style because it violates the following Content Security Policy directive: "style-src 'self' 'nonce-notSecureButWhatever'". Either the 'unsafe-inline' keyword, a hash ('sha256-LXXKlEfDT4mpgGKuaTSsTLqEAceZqHnioSQudzPLbEY='), or a nonce ('nonce-...') is required to enable inline execution. Note that hashes do not apply to event handlers, style attributes and javascript: navigations unless the 'unsafe-hashes' keyword is present.
