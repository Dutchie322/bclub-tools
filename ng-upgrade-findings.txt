- Options page does not open when an extension page is already open (because of location hash)
- Player popup is empty (probably also because of location hash)
- Search fields are invisible in character/people overview
- Extra keywords input field is misaligned in options view
- Buttons look weird and are missing colours in options view
- Show whispers toggle doesn't show state
- Some sort of error in angular or angular-material:
  - 313.js:1 Refused to apply inline style because it violates the following Content Security Policy directive: "style-src 'self' 'nonce-notSecureButWhatever'". Either the 'unsafe-inline' keyword, a hash ('sha256-47DEQpj8HBSa+/TImW+5JCeuQeRkm5NMpJWZG3hSuFU='), or a nonce ('nonce-...') is required to enable inline execution.
